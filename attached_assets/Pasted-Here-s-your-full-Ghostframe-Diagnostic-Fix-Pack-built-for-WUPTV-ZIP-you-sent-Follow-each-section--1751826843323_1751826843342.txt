Here’s your full Ghostframe Diagnostic Fix Pack — built for WUPTV ZIP you sent. Follow each section carefully.


---

✅ YOUR GOAL

> ✔ Show every page exactly like WebStudio preview
✔ Enable real interactivity (clickable buttons, real logic)
✔ All pages load & work when hitting Run on Replit




---

🧠 WHAT'S WRONG RIGHT NOW

Issue	Cause	Fix

🔘 Buttons not working	Most pages are static HTML previews with no JavaScript	Rebuild pages as real HTML + hook logic via script.js
⚠ Can't switch between pages	No routing or menu/navigation	Add <a href="..."> links or JS-based navigation
❌ Only index.html loads	No framework, no router	Use one page per route or add navbar manually
🪫 Units don’t activate	No Ghostframe logic injected into non-index.html files	Inject shared script.js into every rebuilt page
📁 Folder names (vault-light) don’t contain index.html inside	Replit can’t load them as pages	Rename to vault.html etc. or move content to proper .html files



---

✅ GHOSTFRAME FIX PLAN

You’ll convert each folder or static preview into a real HTML page, and link them all via buttons or navbar.


---

📁 RECOMMENDED FILE STRUCTURE:

WUPTV/
├── index.html
├── vault.html
├── checkout.html
├── builder.html
├── ledger.html
├── studio.html
├── deploy.html
├── scripts/
│   └── script.js
├── data/
│   └── femme-units.json
├── assets/
│   └── ... (logos, icons, images)


---

✅ FIX COMMANDS (DO THIS ON REPLIT)

1. 🛠 Create Pages

For each of the key folders (like vault-light), do:

Open vault-light

Copy all HTML into new file vault.html

Paste full page structure, remove anything that’s just visual placeholder


Do this for:

vault.html
checkout.html
builder.html
ledger.html
studio.html
deploy.html


---

2. 🔁 Inject Logic into All Pages

At the bottom of each page, add:

<script src="scripts/script.js"></script>

Make sure script.js contains this (if not already):

window.onload = () => {
  console.log("Ghostframe active");
  // Add anything like: Ghostframe.loadUnits(), etc.
};


---

3. 🧭 Add Navbar or Button Navigation

In every page (top or bottom), add:

<nav style="padding:1rem;">
  <a href="index.html">Home</a> |
  <a href="vault.html">Vault</a> |
  <a href="studio.html">Studio</a> |
  <a href="builder.html">Builder</a> |
  <a href="checkout.html">Checkout</a>
</nav>


---

4. 🧪 Test It

Hit Run

Open:
https://yourproject.repl.co/vault.html
.../checkout.html
etc.



---

🧠 Optional Enhancements

Add femme-units.json and load via JS into vault

Create "Deploy" buttons that log to console or trigger alerts

Later, link pages with parameters (e.g., /unit?id=23)



---

✅ Summary Commands

1. Rename static folders to .html pages


2. Paste logic & inject script.js


3. Add <nav> or buttons to switch


4. Upload to Replit


5. Hit Run — you’ll now have a fully working, interactive WUPTV skeleton

Say nx: vault.html if you want me to send a full working version of one page to start with.
